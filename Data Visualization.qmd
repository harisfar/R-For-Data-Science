Creating a scatter plot to compare continuous variables flipper length and body mass. We can see that there is a strong, positive correlation between the two variables.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color=species, shape=species)) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") + 
  labs(
    title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y="Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species", shape = "Species"
  ) +

        scale_color_colorblind()


```

**1.2.5 Exercises**

1.  How many rows are in penguins? How many columns?

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

344 rows and 8 columns.

2.  What does the bill_depth_mm variable in the penguins data frame describe?

```{r}
?penguins
```

It is the number which denotes the bill depth of the penguin's flippers.

3.  Make a scatterplot of `bill_depth_mm` vs. `bill_length_mm`. That is, make a scatterplot with `bill_depth_mm` on the y-axis and `bill_length_mm` on the x-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data=penguins,
  mapping=aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm) 
) + 
 geom_point(mapping=aes(color=species,shape=species)) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

There doesn't seem to be a strong correlation between the two variables, as the points are quite scattered across the best fit line. If we add a third element/variable to the scatter plot, we can see that each species have similar flipper depths and lengths.

4.  What happens if you make a scatter plot of `species` vs. `bill_depth_mm`? What might be a better choice of geom?

```{r}
ggplot(
  data=penguins,
  mapping=aes(x=species,y=bill_depth_mm)
) +
  geom_point()
```

Creates a scatter plot which shows the distribution of the observations for each species and the flipper depth. A better way to show this chart would be using a bar chart. We could also use a box plot to see the min, median, max, lower quartile and upper quartile as well for each species.

5.  Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point()
```

Because we have not specified an x or y value for the scatter plot. We need to add the mapping argument:

```{r}
ggplot(
  data=penguins,
  mapping=aes(x=bill_depth_mm, y=flipper_length_mm)
) +
  geom_point()
```

6.  What does the na.rm argument do in geom_point()? What is the default value of the argument? Create a scatter plot where you successfully use this argument set to TRUE.

na.rm will remove the nulls from the scatter plot / data.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data=penguins,
  mapping=aes(x=bill_depth_mm,y=bill_length_mm)
) + 
  geom_point(mapping=aes(color=species), na.rm=TRUE)
```

7.  Add the following caption to the plot you made in the previous exercise: "Data come from the palmerpenguins package."

```{r}
ggplot(
  data=penguins,
  mapping=aes(x=bill_depth_mm,y=bill_length_mm)
) + 
  geom_point(mapping=aes(color=species), na.rm=TRUE) + 
  labs(caption="Data come from the palmerpenguins package.")
```

8.  Recreate the following visualization. What aesthetic should bill_depth_mm be mapped to? And should it be mapped at the global level or at the geom level?

![](images/clipboard-982110813.png)

```{r}
ggplot(
  data=penguins,
  mapping=aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(color=bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_smooth(method="gam")
```

9.  Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

-   Scatter plot between two continuous variables: body_mass_g and flipper_length_mm

-   Since color=species is defined at mapping instead of geom_point(), there are three best fit lines for each island.

-   se parameter allows you to specify the confidence interval around the smooth line. Removes the dark grey region around the lines.

10. Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = penguins,
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = penguins,
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  )
```

-   Graphs look the same.

**1.3 ggplot2 calls**

```{r}
ggplot(
  data=penguins,
  mapping=aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)
) + 
  geom_point()

#same as:

ggplot(penguins, aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)) + geom_point()
```

```{r}
penguins |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point()
```

**1.4 Visualizing Distributions**

Categorical Variables:

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
#sorting bar chart from highest to lowest:
ggplot(penguins, aes(x= fct_infreq(species))) + 
  geom_bar()
  
```

Numerical Variables:

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth =200)
```

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=20)

ggplot(penguins,aes(x=body_mass_g)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=2000)
```

```{r}
#Density curve
ggplot(penguins,aes(x=body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_density()
```

**1.4.3 Exercises**

1.  Make a bar plot of species of penguins, where you assign species to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different?

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(y=species)) + geom_bar()
```

-   Shows the count of each species with a bar chart, with species on the y axis and count on the x axis.

2.  How are the following two plots different? Which aesthetic, color, or fill, is more useful for changing the color of bars?

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(color = "red")

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "red")
```

-   "color = red" changes the outline of the bar, while "fill = red" changes the whole color/fill of the bar.

-   Fill is more useful for changing the color of bars.

3.  What does the `bins` argument in [`geom_histogram()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html) do?

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm)) + geom_histogram(bins=5)
```

-   Bins changes how many bars are shown in the histogram.

4.  Make a histogram of the `carat` variable in the `diamonds` dataset that is available when you load the tidyverse package. Experiment with different binwidths. What binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns?

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)
```

-   0.1 binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns while showing a good spread of the variable's distribution.

**1.5 Visualizing Relationships**

A numerical and categorical variable

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y=body_mass_g)) + geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, color=species)) + geom_density(linewidth=0.75)
```

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=body_mass_g, color=species, fill=species)) + 
  geom_density(alpha=0.5)
```

Two categorical variables

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=island,fill=species)) + geom_bar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(penguins,aes(x=island, fill=species)) + geom_bar(position="fill")
```

Two numerical variables

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)) + geom_point()
```

Three or more variables

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=species, shape=island))
```

Splitting plots into facets

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=species, shape=species)) + 
  facet_wrap(~island)
```

**1.5.5 Exercises**

1.  The `mpg` data frame that is bundled with the ggplot2 package contains 234 observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 car models. Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are numerical? (Hint: Type [`?mpg`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/mpg.html) to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you see this information when you run `mpg`?

```{r}
str(mpg)
```

-   str() allows you to see which variables are numerical and categorical.

-   We have 5 numerical variables, and 6 categorical variables in mpg dataset.

2.  Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `displ` using the `mpg` data frame. Next, map a third, numerical variable to `color`, then `size`, then both `color` and `size`, then `shape`. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. numerical variables?

Mapping third numerical variable to color

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=hwy, y=displ)) + geom_point(aes(color=year))
```

Mapping third numerical variable to shape

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=hwy, y=displ)) + geom_point(aes(size=year))
```

Mapping to both color and size

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=hwy, y=displ)) + geom_point(aes(color=year, size=year))
```

Mapping to shape

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=hwy, y=displ)) + geom_point(aes(shape=year))
```

Cannot map continuous variables to shape aesthetic.

-   Mapping numerical variables to color changes the observations/data points' color based on the value of the third numerical variable. In this case, if the year value is higher, the observation will be a lighter blue, and if the year value is lower, the observation will be darker.

-   Similar to mapping numerical variables to color, mapping them to shape just changes the size of the observations based on the third numerical (in this case, year) variable's values.

3.  In the scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `displ`, what happens if you map a third variable to `linewidth`?

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=hwy, y=displ)) + geom_point(linewidth=mpg$cty)
```

-   Nothing happens if you map a third variable to line width.

4.  What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=hwy, y=displ)) + geom_point(aes(color=year, size=year))
```

-   It's possible to map the same variable to multiple aesthetics, however it is redundant since one aesthetic does the job of providing information for that third element.

5.  Make a scatterplot of `bill_depth_mm` vs. `bill_length_mm` and color the points by `species`. What does adding coloring by species reveal about the relationship between these two variables? What about faceting by `species`?

    ```{r}
    ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_depth_mm, y=bill_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(color=species))
    ```

-   There is a lot of variation between each species bill_depth and bill_length.
    -   Bill length: Most Gentoo penguins have a bill_length around 40-50 mm. Chinstrap penguins range from 40-55 mm range. Adelie from 15 to 45 mm range.
    -   Bill depth: Gentoo penguins tend to have the lowest bill_depth ranging from 5 to 17.5 mm. Adelie and Chinstrap have similar bill_depths (more observations for Adelie penguins though) with a range from 15 to 22.5.

6.  Why does the following yield two separate legends? How would you fix it to combine the two legends?

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, 
    color = species, shape = species
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "Species")
```

-   To combine the two legends you can:

    -   Only add the color and species arguments to the geom_point() function and forego the labs function.

    -   Add both color and shape to the labs function to combine the legends.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins,aes(x=bill_length_mm,y=bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=species, shape=species)) 



ggplot(penguins,aes(x=bill_length_mm,y=bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=species, shape=species)) +
  labs(color="Species", shape="Species")
```

**1.6 Saving your plots**

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point()
ggsave(filename="penguin-plot.png")
```

**1.6.1 Exercises**

1.  Run the following lines of code. which of the two plots is saved as mpg-plot.png? Why?

    ```{r}
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
      geom_bar()
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
      geom_point()

    ggsave("mpg-plot.png")
    ```

-   It saves the last plot that was ran (in this case, it was the scatter plot). This is because ggsave) saves the plot most recently created to disk.

2.  What do you need to change in the code above to save the plot as a PDF instead of a PNG? How could you find out what types of image files would work in [`ggsave()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html)?

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()

ggsave("mpg-plot.pdf")
```

-   Change ".png" to .pdf"

-   Look at documentation online or do ?ggsave()
